#### 1.Dropout doesn't work here.

Dropout could decrease accuracy dramatically, because our [data set is small and we're still underfit](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/299292/dropout-makes-performance-worse)


#### 2.Only augment upper part of the image

Bc the lower part of the image is just handle, we want it to remain unchanged for NN.extract_sensor_values function to extract additional information.

#### 3.Regerssion network is better than Classification network

#### 4.Useful blog
